## Overview

The United Nations Standard Products and Services Code is a global standard
for classifying companies. This code classification is fundamental to the 
classifying procurement contracts and provides the basis for distinguishing similar types of tenders.
Please read more about the hierarchical convention here: https://www.unspsc.org/.

## The task

This project is open ended and designed to provide a platform to show your creativity,
coding skills and ability to interpret requirements. We have created a simple, but
flawed search bar where users can select categories that they may be interested in.
Your job is to improve it! Whether you start from scratch or extend our base code
is entirely up to you. There is also no strict requirement on how the search bar should
function. We want you to think of the best user experience possible :).

In short, what we hope to achieve with this componenet is to create a dropdown for users
to select categories that are relevant to them.

Hint: the codes are classified in a hierarchial manner, so there is a one-to-many 
relationship between each level and the level below it.

If you have any questions, please reach out to matthew.oh@cotiss.com and ask away - 
we're here to help!

## Assessment

Your project will be assessed on three key criteria:
1. User experience
2. Code quality
3. User interface

Good luck!
