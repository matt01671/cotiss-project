## Instructions

In order to complete this project, please duplicate it into a private repository.
Once that is complete, provide matt01671 and danew with access. You will have
7 days from when you have started the project to complete it. Please send an 
email to harry.w@cotiss.com and matthew.oh@cotiss.com once you have finished.

Please ensure you use git workflow so we can track the updates you have made and
comment any assumptions you make.

We respect your time and therefore, recommend time-boxing this exercice to three to four hours.

## Overview

The United Nations Standard Products and Services Code is a global standard
for classifying companies and types of contracts. This code classification is fundamental to 
classifying procurement contracts and provides the basis for distinguishing similar types of tenders.
Please read more about the hierarchical convention here: https://www.unspsc.org/.

## The task

This project is open ended and designed to provide a platform to show your creativity,
coding skills and ability to interpret requirements. We have created a simple, but
flawed search bar / dropdown where users can select categories that they may be interested in.
Your job is to improve it! There are several ways we think it can be improved, here are some
ideas but if you have others that is great also!
1. Improve the matching algorithm so the user input is better aligned with suggestions,
2. Replace Semantic UI with a custom component,
3. Convert to a nested dropdown that takes advantage of the hierarchical manner of the UNSPSC codes.

There is also no strict requirement on how the search bar should
function. We want you to think of the best user experience possible :). There are no right
or wrong answers so don't overthink it - just state your assumptions and justification for the 
improvements you think are best.

If you have any questions, please reach out to matthew.oh@cotiss.com and ask away - 
we're here to help!

## Assessment

Your project will be assessed on three key criteria:
1. User experience
2. Code quality
3. User interface

Good luck!
